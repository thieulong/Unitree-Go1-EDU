This project compares the performance of differential-drive and omni-drive robots in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios, specifically focusing on robot following behaviors. 
It explores various aspects such as following strategies, obstacle avoidance techniques, and robot positioning. 
The objective is to gain insights into different facets of HRI, including robot positioning, alternative path-planning algorithms, transitions between following and guiding, and the impact of additional tasks like carrying loads.

The proposed solution utilizes ROS Melodic for software infrastructure, 2D Lidar for person tracking, and integrated ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance on a quadruped robot platform. 
The aim is to develop a robust system capable of stable tracking in diverse environments.
